 The View class displays the content
 
 Typically your view control would be used to display content or functionality in your module.
 
 View may be the only control you have in your project depending on the complexity of your module
 
 Because the control inherits from ProgrammingModuleBase you have access to any custom properties
 defined there, as well as properties from DNN such as PortalId, ModuleId, TabId, UserId and many more.
