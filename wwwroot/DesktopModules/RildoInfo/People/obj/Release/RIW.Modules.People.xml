 Typically your view control would be used to display content or functionality in your module.
 
 View may be the only control you have in your project depending on the complexity of your module
 
 Because the control inherits from RIW_PeopleModuleBase you have access to any custom properties
 defined there, as well as properties from DNN such as PortalId, ModuleId, TabId, UserId and many more.

 The Controller class for People
 
 The FeatureController class is defined as the BusinessController in the manifest file (.dnn)

 The IPortable interface is used to import/export content from a DNN module
 
 The ISearchable interface is used by DNN to index the content of a module
 
 The IUpgradeable interface allows module developers to execute code during the upgrade 
 process for a module.
