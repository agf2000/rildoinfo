 The View class displays the content
 
 Typically your view control would be used to display content or functionality in your module.
 
 View may be the only control you have in your project depending on the complexity of your module
 
 Because the control inherits from RIW_ProductsModuleBase you have access to any custom properties
 defined there, as well as properties from DNN such as PortalId, ModuleId, TabId, UserId and many more.

 The Settings class manages Module Settings
 
 Typically your settings control would be used to manage settings for your module.
 There are two types of settings, ModuleSettings, and TabModuleSettings.
 
 ModuleSettings apply to all "copies" of a module on a site, no matter which page the module is on. 
 
 TabModuleSettings apply only to the current module on the current page, if you copy that module to
 another page the settings are not transferred.
 
 If you happen to save both TabModuleSettings and ModuleSettings, TabModuleSettings overrides ModuleSettings.
 
 Below we have some examples of how to access these settings but you will need to uncomment to use.
 
 Because the control inherits from RIW_ProductsSettingsBase you have access to any custom properties
 defined there, as well as properties from DNN such as PortalId, ModuleId, TabId, UserId and many more.

 The Controller class for Products
 
 The FeatureController class is defined as the BusinessController in the manifest file (.dnn)
 DotNetNuke will poll this class to find out which Interfaces the class implements. 
 
 The IPortable interface is used to import/export content from a DNN module
 
 The ISearchable interface is used by DNN to index the content of a module
 
 The IUpgradeable interface allows module developers to execute code during the upgrade 
 process for a module.
 
 Below you will find stubbed out implementations of each, uncomment and populate with your own data
